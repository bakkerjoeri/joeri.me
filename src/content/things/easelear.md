In Easelear you create bookmarks, tag them and create smart lists to browse your collection of bookmarks. Without logging in, it stores your data locally. If you want, you can make an account to store it in the cloud. The app is written in Vue and the back-end is powered by Google Firebase.

I mostly created Easelear (or *Ezelsoor*, its Dutch title) because I wanted a better way to organize things I found on or off the web than just dumping things into whatever notes app I am using. For example, I use it to keep track of articles and talks I want to check out, movies and shows I want to watch. Both of these are easily looked up using filtered lists.
