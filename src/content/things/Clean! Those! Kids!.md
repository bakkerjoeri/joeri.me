Clean! Those! Kids! was made in collaboration with a friend. We wanted to learn a new game engine, Godot, and learn about game design from each other. We spent a weekend and change on this frantic, goofy high score chaser. The game reflects the fun we had creating it. It appeared in the 15th issue of indiegame magazine (Indiepocalypse #15)[https://pizzapranks.itch.io/indiepocalypse-15].

Clean! Those! Kids! was made in (Godot)[https://godotengine.org/]. Its pixelart was created in (Aseprite)[https://www.aseprite.org/].
