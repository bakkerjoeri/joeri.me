A collection of classes and functions that helps you build games in JavaScript. It's fully typed in TypeScript. You can pick and choose what you use or implement yourself, the code doesn't care what you're making and how you're making it, it just wants to help you do it.

Use heks to help you with any of these things:

* Set up and mount the game's canvas. It will automatically scale for beautiful, crisp low-res games.
* Set up your game loop. You can use pausing and single steps for debugging.
* Handle keyboard and mouse interactions.
* Listen for and emit events.
* Data driven game state management.
* Loading sprites and running sprite animations.
