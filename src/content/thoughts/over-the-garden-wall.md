# October's ultimate comfort watch: Over the garden wall

We have a yearly fall tradition. Every October, when the leaves turn red and start falling, things get chilly and windy and everything becomes slightly darker, we huddle under a blanket and go into the unknown.

We watch *Over the Garden Wall*.

The show is perfect for Spooky Season, during the year's cold months, or anytime actually. In the span of 10 episodes, each 10 minutes long, we get lost in the woods with two brothers just trying to find their way home, and meet its strange denizens with each their own strange tales and who sing *the best songs*.

It's whimsical and spooky, funny and sweet. It's a fantastic show. And that, my dears, is a rock fact.
