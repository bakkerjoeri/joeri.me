	<h1>👋🏻 Hi, I'm Joeri</h1>

	<p>
		I'm a frontend developer, currently working at <a href="https://decorrespondent.nl">De Correspondent</a>
		I enjoy building elegant and accessible things for the web.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also like to make games in my spare time, some of which I actually finish and release.
		You can find them on <a href="https://bakkerjoeri.itch.io/">itch.io</a>.
