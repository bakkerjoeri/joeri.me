# 👋🏼 Hi, I'm Joeri

I'm a frontend developer, currently working at [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl). I enjoy building elegant and accessible things for the web.

I also like to make games in my spare time, some of which I actually finish and release. You can find them on [itch.io](https://bakkerjoeri.itch.io/).

Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bakkerjoeri), check out my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bakkerjoeri/).
